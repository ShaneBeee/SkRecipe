# SkRecipe

A Skript addon for adding custom recipes to your server, with extra effects for locking/unlocking recipes for players, and handling the customization of knowledgebooks. This addon is made to work on 1.13+. Due to changes in how recipes are created in 1.13, I will **not** be adding support for 1.12.2 or below.

See the [**WIKI**](https://github.com/ShaneBeee/SkRecipe/wiki) for a more detailed example on how all the syntaxes work.
